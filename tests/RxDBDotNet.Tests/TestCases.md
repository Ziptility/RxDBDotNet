# RxDBDotNet E2E Test Cases

This document outlines a comprehensive set of end-to-end (E2E) test cases designed to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the RxDBDotNet library. These tests focus on the correct implementation of the RxDB replication protocol, integration with Hot Chocolate GraphQL, and the proper handling of Entity Framework Core (EF Core) in a distributed application context.

The test cases are organized to progress from basic operations to more complex scenarios, ensuring that fundamental functionalities are tested before moving on to advanced features. This approach allows for a systematic validation of the library's capabilities and its adherence to the RxDB replication protocol.

## Test Cases

  {
      Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
      Name = "Test Workspace",
      UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
      IsDeleted = false
  };
  ```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Send a GraphQL mutation to create the new workspace document
2. Retrieve the created document using a GraphQL query

**Expected Results:**

  ```csharp
  var documents = new List<Workspace>
  {
      new Workspace
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          Name = "Workspace 1",
          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(-2),
          IsDeleted = false
      },
      new Workspace
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          Name = "Workspace 2",
          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(-1),
          IsDeleted = false
      },
      new Workspace
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          Name = "Workspace 3",
          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
          IsDeleted = false
      }
  };
  ```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Send a GraphQL query to pull documents with null checkpoint and a limit of 10

**Expected Results:**
- The query should return all documents, ordered by their UpdatedAt timestamp
- The response should include a new checkpoint based on the latest document
- The number of returned documents should not exceed the specified limit

**Additional Notes:**
- Verify that the documents are returned in the correct order (oldest to newest)
- Ensure that the checkpoint in the response matches the UpdatedAt and Id of the newest document

#### Test Case 2.2: Pull Documents with Filtering

**Objective:** Verify that documents can be pulled with filtering applied, ensuring that the filtering works correctly while adhering to the RxDB replication protocol.

**Preconditions:**
- Multiple documents of various types exist in the system
- The GraphQL server is configured with filtering support

**Data Setup:**
- Create at least 10 User documents with varied attributes:
  ```csharp
  var users = new List<User>
  {
      new User
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          FirstName = "John",
          LastName = "Doe",
          Email = "john.doe@example.com",
          Role = UserRole.User,
          WorkspaceId = workspaceId,
          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-5),
          IsDeleted = false
      },
      new User
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          FirstName = "Jane",
          LastName = "Smith",
          Email = "jane.smith@example.com",
          Role = UserRole.Admin,
          WorkspaceId = workspaceId,
          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-3),
          IsDeleted = false
      },
      // ... (add more users with varying attributes)
  };
  ```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Send a GraphQL query to pull User documents with the following filters:
   - `FirstName` contains "Jo"
   - `Role` is `User`
   - `UpdatedAt` is greater than 7 days ago
2. Set a limit of 5 documents
3. Use a null checkpoint (initial pull)

**GraphQL Query:**
```graphql
query {
  pullUser(
    checkpoint: null,
    limit: 5,
    where: {
      firstName: { contains: "Jo" },
      role: { eq: USER },
      updatedAt: { gt: "2023-07-11T00:00:00Z" }  # Assuming current date is 2023-07-18
    }
  ) {
    documents {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      email
      role
      updatedAt
      isDeleted
    }
    checkpoint {
      lastDocumentId
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- The query should return only User documents that match all the specified criteria:
  - First names containing "Jo"
  - Role is User
  - Updated within the last 7 days
- The number of returned documents should not exceed the specified limit (5)
- The returned documents should be ordered by their `UpdatedAt` timestamp (oldest to newest)
- The response should include a valid checkpoint based on the latest returned document
- Verify that the filtering does not interfere with the checkpoint mechanism of the RxDB replication protocol

**Additional Verifications:**
1. Perform a subsequent pull operation using the checkpoint from the first query:
   - It should only return documents that were updated after the checkpoint
   - The filtering should still be applied
2. Modify the filter to include deleted documents (`isDeleted: true`) and verify that soft-deleted documents are included when explicitly requested
3. Test with various combination of filters to ensure all filterable fields work correctly
4. Verify that invalid filter inputs are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages

**Execution Steps:**
1. Execute the initial filtered pull query
2. Verify the results match the expected criteria
3. Extract the checkpoint from the response
4. Create or update some documents that match the filter criteria
5. Execute a subsequent pull query using the checkpoint from step 3
6. Verify that only new or updated documents are returned, and they still match the filter criteria

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that the filtering logic is applied at the database level for efficiency
- Verify that the filtering does not break the RxDB replication protocol's consistency guarantees
- Check that the performance of filtered queries is acceptable, especially with large datasets

#### Test Case 2.3: Pull Documents with Projections and Filtering

  {
      new User
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          FirstName = "John",
          LastName = "Doe",
          Email = "john.doe@example.com",
          Role = UserRole.User,
          WorkspaceId = workspaceId,
          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-5),
          IsDeleted = false
      },
      new User
      {
          Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
          FirstName = "Jane",
          LastName = "Smith",
          Email = "jane.smith@example.com",

          UpdatedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-3),
          IsDeleted = false
      },
      // ... (add more users with varying attributes)
  };
  ```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Send a GraphQL query to pull User documents with the following:
   - Projection: Include only `id`, `firstName`, and `email`
   - Filter: `Role` is `User`
   - Limit: 5 documents
   - Checkpoint: null (initial pull)

**GraphQL Query:**
```graphql
query {
  pullUser(
    checkpoint: null,
    limit: 5,
    where: { role: { eq: USER } }
  ) {
    documents {
      id
      firstName
      email
    }
    checkpoint {
      lastDocumentId
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- The query should return User documents that match the specified criteria:
  - Role is User
- The returned documents should only include the projected fields: `id`, `firstName`, and `email`
- Other fields like `lastName`, `role`, `updatedAt`, and `isDeleted` should not be present in the response
- The number of returned documents should not exceed the specified limit (5)
- The response should include a valid checkpoint based on the latest returned document
- Verify that the projection and filtering do not interfere with the checkpoint mechanism of the RxDB replication protocol

**Additional Verifications:**
1. Perform a subsequent pull operation using the checkpoint from the first query:
   - It should only return documents that were updated after the checkpoint
   - The projection and filtering should still be applied
2. Test with various combinations of projections and filters to ensure all fields can be projected and filtered correctly
3. Verify that requesting non-existent fields in the projection is handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. Check that the `UpdatedAt` field is always included in the actual database query, even if not projected, to ensure proper ordering and checkpoint functionality

**Execution Steps:**
1. Execute the initial projected and filtered pull query
2. Verify the results match the expected criteria and only include the projected fields
3. Extract the checkpoint from the response
4. Create or update some documents that match the filter criteria
5. Execute a subsequent pull query using the checkpoint from step 3
6. Verify that only new or updated documents are returned, they still match the filter criteria, and only include the projected fields

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that the projection logic is applied at the database level for efficiency
- Verify that the projection does not break the RxDB replication protocol's consistency guarantees
- Check that the performance of projected queries is acceptable, especially with large datasets
- Confirm that the ordering by `UpdatedAt` and `Id` is maintained even when these fields are not projected
